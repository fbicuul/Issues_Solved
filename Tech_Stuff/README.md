Trouble with Git Push?

Are you facing the ACCESS DENIED challenge of pushing your files into your remote Github page on github.com?

Try checking your Git Credentials to ensure you’re using the exact details of the Github account you want to push into. 

>> Go to your “START” menu on your PC

>> Search for Control Panel

>> Then search for Credential Manager

>> You’ll find two managers (Web and Windows)

>>Select the Windows Manager, you’ll see Git credentials in the list

>> Edit or modify the email and password (if it isn’t the actual credential for the Github account)

AND, THAT IS IT… ENJOY!
